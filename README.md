# Freeboard

[Freeboard](https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard), by Jim Heising and Bug Labs, Inc., 
is a very popular dashboard user interface (currently 1834 stars). It is released under the MIT license.

This module gives you Freeboard as securable content items.  You can create, edit (the JSON), and grant permissions 
to roles in the Orchard admin interface.  The `view` link takes you to your freeboard where you can design, and save it.
